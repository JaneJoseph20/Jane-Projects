# Jane-Projects
Hello there! I'm Jane Joseph, a recent graduate with a Master's in Business Analytics from Denver University - Daniels College of Business. Embarking on my journey into the professional world, I'm thrilled to showcase a selection of projects I've undertaken, both during my academic pursuits and beyond. 

### Project 1: ANALYSIS OF THE SHOW F.R.I.E.N.D.S
Leveraged Python's popular data analysis libraries in Jupyter Notebook, including Pandas and NumPy, to perform comprehensive data cleaning and analysis of the Friends TV show dataset from Kaggle. Utilized Pandas to import and manipulate Series and DataFrame objects for efficient data wrangling and exploration. Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn data visualization libraries to generate insightful charts and graphs, such as heatmaps and bar charts, that helped highlight key data patterns and trends.

### Project 2: Unveiling the Secrets of Flight Ticket Pricing: Statistical Regression Analysis of Factors Influencing Airfare
Led an advanced statistical analysis of domestic flight prices using Kaggle data, applying regression modeling techniques to discern nuanced factors influencing ticket prices in the Indian market. Employed robust statistical measures like P-values and R-squared to evaluate the significance and accuracy of the model. Presented the insights in a comprehensive business report.

### Project 4: Musical Insights: Analyzing the Stories in Song Data
In this project, I delved into the world of song lyrics using R, employing Tidy verse to tidy up the data and prep it for analysis.  I roped in topic modeling to figure out the main themes running through the lyrics.  Brought in a network diagram and some graphs to turn numbers into awesome charts and graphs that tell a story.

### Project 5: Predicting Customer Purchase Behavior: A Machine Learning Analysis
Leveraged R's powerful machine learning libraries such as tidymodels and Tree to predict customer purchase behavior. Utilized logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to model purchase likelihood and amount. Employed R's flexdashboard library to compile all analyses into an interactive dashboard for seamless data consumption.
