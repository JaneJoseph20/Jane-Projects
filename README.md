### Project 4: Musical Insights: Analyzing the Stories in Song Data
In this project, I delved into the world of song lyrics using R, employing Tidy verse to tidy up the data and prep it for analysis.  I roped in topic modeling to figure out the main themes running through the lyrics.  Brought in a network diagram and some graphs to turn numbers into awesome charts and graphs that tell a story.
